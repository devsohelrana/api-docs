## API Documentation

An API (Application Programming Interface) documentation provides detailed information about how developers can use and integrate an API into their applications. It typically includes:  

- **Overview:** A brief introduction to the API, its purpose, and key functionalities.  
- **Authentication:** Instructions on how to authenticate and authorize API requests (e.g., API keys, OAuth, tokens).  
- **Endpoints:** A list of available API endpoints, their URLs, request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), parameters, and expected responses.  
- **Request & Response Examples:** Sample API requests and responses in JSON or XML format for clarity.  
- **Error Handling:** A guide to common errors, status codes, and troubleshooting tips.  
- **Rate Limits:** Information on API usage limits and restrictions.  
- **SDKs & Libraries:** Links to available client libraries or SDKs for easier integration.  
- **Change Logs:** A record of API updates, new features, and deprecated functionalities.  

Good API documentation should be clear, concise, and include real-world examples to help developers effectively utilize the API. Do you need a specific API documented?
